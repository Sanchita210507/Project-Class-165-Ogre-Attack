# Ogre Attack

The oldest city of the arches is under attack by the Ogre. The Ogre is a giant man-like monster that eats humans. It is believed that they are afraid of blue and green 
colors.

In this project, I have designed a 3D Ogre Shooting Game. The Ogre will throw fireballs towards the player to kill the player. The player has to destroy all the monsters 
by shooting at the monsters.
